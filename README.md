Overview of project

Project :- To Do task app

Objective:-
           The objective of this project to perform daily record tracking app. It help to maintain a taily record we added.
           Creating a basic to-do list application involves HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.




Explanation:-

          HTML: Defines the structure of the  page with an input field for adding tasks, a button to add tasks, and a <ul> element to 
          contain the tasks.

          CSS: Provides basic styling to make the app look presentable and user-friendly.

          JavaScript: Handles the functionality of adding tasks to the list dynamically. When the "Add Task" button is clicked, it creates
          a new <li> element containing the task text and a delete button. Clicking the delete button removes the task from the list.
          This is a simple implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add features like editing tasks, marking them as 
          complete, or saving tasks to local storage for persistence across sessions.
